### EXAMPLE SCENARIO
man
woman
me
man

 - reasons above is inappropriate
 - inappropriate if switched?
 - 


#### What is appropriate behavior after this?

If you are: woman, man, me, man's boss, everyone's boss


### INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY

Organizations have culture.

Organizations know things -http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_knowledge
 And organizations remember thigns.  
-- woman is still thinking of him as "peter the inappropriate guy"


- Culture as factor of physical proximity / central location

- Culture as bystander of remote work

- Institutional/corporate parallel of diaspora concept, but without co-opting the idea of diaspora. 
 -- how culture is maintained in these spread apart groups
 -- mechanisms of culture preservation and nurturing
 -- http://thesaurus.com/browse/diaspora  meeeh

- The oral history
 -- told by people who are geographically and perhaps temporally diverse 
 -- http://institutionalmemory.hbs.edu/narratives/

- Chatrooms as extensions/improvements of oral histories
-- recorded conversations and moments in history that, in many programs, are available forever..


### HE'S NOT THAT GUY
Ok, then what's the problem with apologizing?  
I've never met you so I don't knwo if you *are* that guy or not.
**DANGERZONE** if they had met, would it all be okay now?


### THE PROBLEM WITH PUBLIC APOLOGIES
- public apology.
-- humiliating for the guy
too much time has passed (perhaps)




### WHAT MESSAGE IS SENT TO EVERYONE ELSE
- that this is okay
- that maybe i'll be on your case but it doesn't matter
- that we don't actually value our female employees quality fo work space
that only the other women stand up
that our hiring practice is not the same as our workspace

### THE ISSUE OF SCALE
- scale of the single offense and scale as in "does this scale as our organization grows."
- this is such a mild example

#### If this is small, what's big
- we only care when it's BIG?  
- will we wait until it gets worse?
- will we wait until it's a liability?
- why do we assume the woman is being too senseitive
-- overreaction mentality is what stops people from speaking up
- Mountain/molehill
- "We know what is appropriate" which is also part of a sexist space
