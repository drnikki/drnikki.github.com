One of my favorite things about being a programmer is that I can figure out ways to solve little problems.  Little non-problems, even.  Over the last week, there have been Time Warner internet outages in my neighborhood. 

So I built a busted little script that tells me when my internet has come back on.  I've just saved you about 4 minutes writing your own.
