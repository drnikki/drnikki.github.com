Hi, I’m Nikki. I’m a New York City-based programmer. I've been making websites for 15 years, and have spent the last 7 working as a Drupal developer.  In the last year, I've also done Symfony, Magento and some Rails work. 

I’m currently a freelance Drupal engineer working with Phase2 Technology. I spent eight months as the CTO of a startup before it shut down (as startups are wont to do), and that was enough. I used to be a Technical Architect at [LBi/MRY][], the Lead Developer at [DivX][], tech lead at [Workhabit][], and development lead for [Americans Elect][].

I often freelance on short projects. In the last year or two, I’ve
worked on projects for [Qualcomm][], [Dove][], [Jewish Funds for Social Justice][],
[Slow Food USA][], [LinkedIn][], [Countryfest][], [Intellivent
Group][], [Archetype.me][] and a few others that my NDAs won’t let me reveal.

Get in touch if you’d like some work done, or if you just want to say
hi.
