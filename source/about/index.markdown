Hi, I’m Nikki. I’m a New York City-based programmer. I've been making websites for 15 years, and have spent the last 5 working as a Drupal developer.  In the last six months, I've done Symfony, Django and some Rails work. 

I’m currently a  Technical Architect at LBi/MRY where I'm the Technical Director for a Coca-Cola project. I used to
be the Lead Developer at [DivX][], tech lead at [Workhabit][], and development lead for [Americans Elect][].

I often freelance on short projects. In the last year or two, I’ve
worked on projects for [Dove][], [Jewish Funds for Social Justice][],
[Slow Food USA][], [LinkedIn][], [Countryfest][], [Intellivent
Group][], [Archetype.me][] and a few others that my NDAs won’t let me reveal.

Get in touch if you’d like some work done, or if you just want to say
hi.
